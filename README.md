# stocks-visualizer-jupyter
Visualize Stocks in your portfolio using matplotlib and jupyter. 

The idea is to provide commands for generating useful portfolio graphs inline in jupyter. 
For instance, to compare the performance of the FANG stocks in your portfolioto a stock of your choice (i.e. QQQ) in a single command, that you could execute when you want.

It also opens a UI to generate this command easily. 

The input data I currently have is a MyStockProtfolio CSV (any csv that describes buys/sells), and will add later  Interactive brokers account's positions. 
The additional input data is account in Interactive Brokers. 

Having said that, it is in preliminary condition and not guaranteed to work, currently.
