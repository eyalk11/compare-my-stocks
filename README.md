# Compare My Stocks

## General 
Visualize the performance of stocks in your portfolio or that  you are interested in.
There is maximal control over charts, and a variaty of comparision options. 

You can divide the stocks into sectors, and compare the performance of different sector! 

For instance: 

* **Chart of profit of sectors in your portfolio and of the entire portfolio relative to a certain point in time.**

(You won't see your portfolio unless you will upload your transactions)  

* **Chart of specific airlines and the airlines as a group compared with nasdaq:**

(The difference in the change percentage-wise since 04/01/2021 between ESYJY and the nasdaq is ~48% at this point at time, signficantly lower than the airlines as a group. This is example of an advanced usage.)

## Running Instructions

Remark: **Not fully tested, and prerelease. Some features may not work correctly.** 

 1. Install [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/download) 
 2. pip install --no-binary  :all: git+https://github.com/eyalk11/compare-my-stocks.git
 3. Look at ~/.compare_my_stocks/myconfig.py and set it as you wish (will work without it).

    Notice that it is recommended to provide a CSV in MyStocksProtoflio format for every transaction (Type is Buy/Sell):
 
 4. python -m compare_my_stocks 

* Depends on inverstpy and json_editor. Needed https://github.com/eyalk11/investpy  https://github.com/eyalk11/json-editor

## Final words
* This is being developed in QT with matplotlib amd pandas. I tried to use advanced features of pandas and numpy for fast calculation(sometimes).



* I belive this software provides many useful features that are usually paid for. This despite developing this in a short period, on my spare time. I would very much apperiate community contribution. And welcome you to contribute, send bugs and discuss (will open gitter when appropriate). 

* If you have an idea about how it will be best integrated with active stock research using Jupyter Lab or something else, let me know. 

* The controls should be self explantory... Try it.
